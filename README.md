Weather_Restaurant_API_app
#App Name: Local Weather and Restaurants App

#Git Hub Repo Name: campion365/Weather_Restaurant_API_app

#Link to Live App: https://campion365.github.io/Weather_Restaurant_API_app/

#Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#Project Summary: I built this app to serve as a basic utility/dayplanner resource providing information that most people find pertinent:

Weather information to help inform how to dress and what to bring to work (example y/n to needing an umbrella) AND

Restaurant ideas for lunch at work and/or dinner

Overarching idea is that the app could one day be monetized by advertiser sponsorship and inclusion from a variety of industries. For instance, a restaurant could secure top listing positions or perhaps a clothing company could provide clothing ideas based on weather and we then integrate a shopping widget into results. #Screenshots:
